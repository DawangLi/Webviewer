CXP WebViewer
=============

CXP WebViewer is a desktop client application which permits the playback of certain live video streams and video archives with synchronized sides and TabletPC ink annotations.  It embeds  Windows Media Player and contains a subset of [UW Classroom Presenter](http://github.com/classroompresenter/cp3) functionality to display the audio, video and presentation.


CXP WebViewer was designed to support content originating from [ConferenceXP](http://github.com/conferencexp/conferencexp), using presentation data from [UW Classroom Presenter](http://github.com/classroompresenter/cp3), and streamed or post-processed using the tools [CXP Archive Transcoder](http://github.com/fvideon/archivetranscoder) or [CXP Windows Media Gateway](http://github.com/fvideon/wmgateway).
